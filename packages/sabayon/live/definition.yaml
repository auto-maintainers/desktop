## To note: this package also consumes user/group default from upper layers in finalizers.
## In this way they are not tracked by the package manager,
## and we consume the defaults during install only if the host didn't had any installed

## This ideally should be handled by the installed layers (e.g. layer/minimal-x) should do this, but
## to avoid repetitions we do it here as we collect runtime steps common from all the layers already
